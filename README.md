# AC-GAN: Integrating Attractor Constraints into Generative Adversarial Networks for Dynamic PPG Synthesis

## Overview

We introduce AC-GAN, a novel generative adversarial network for PPG synthesis with data-driven attractor constraints.  AC-GAN comprises two distinct components: a data-driven attractor extraction network and the GAN with attractor constraints. We first designed and pre-trained an attractor extraction network to represent the attractor characteristics of PPG signals. Then we incorporate this component into the GAN framework and develop specialized loss functions. 

Our basic implementation of AC-GAN is provided in this repository.
